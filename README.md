## Getting started

This is a basic VueJs, Vuetify, Vue Router and Vuex skeleton written on JavaScript using async/await. Great for building an MVP for your project.

This project is created to help other developers create a **basic VueJS app in an easy way**. This basic example shows how powerful and simple JavaScript and VueJS can be. Do you want to contribute? Pull requests are always welcome to show more features.

Hi! I'm Daniel Avellaneda, I'm currently an open source enthusiast and dedicate my free time to open source projects.

I'm the creator and maintainer of [node-express-mongodb-jwt-rest-api-skeleton](https://github.com/davellanedam/node-express-mongodb-jwt-rest-api-skeleton/blob/master/README.md) and [vue-skeleton-mvp](https://github.com/davellanedam/vue-skeleton-mvp/blob/master/README.md) both with thousands of downloads. These projects are what I call a Free starter web app combo: API + Frontend.

I'm doing my best to provide you a good experience when using my apps, so if you like what I'm doing and wish to say "thanks!", feel free to buy me a coffee :coffee:

## Demo

A demo of this Frontend is located at: <https://vue-demo.daniel-avellaneda.com>

### Login credentials

email: `admin@admin.com`  
password: `12345`

**IMPORTANT:** Database resets every 30 mins like "12:00am, 12:30am, 1:00am" and so on. So anything you do will be lost after a short time.

Demo is also linked to a Node.js express.js MongoDB JWT REST API project that shows how this frontend can be integrated to an API.  
Repo is here: <https://github.com/davellanedam/node-express-mongodb-jwt-rest-api-skeleton>

This project use Vue Router HTML5 History Mode, this means when you are in development mode you can hit Cmd+R (mac) or F5 (Windows) to reload the page and it will work, but when the project is built you will have problems, so will need to do a small change in your web server to make that work. Please read the official Vue Router documentation here: <https://router.vuejs.org/guide/essentials/history-mode.html#example-server-configurations>
